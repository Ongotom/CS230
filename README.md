Software Design Document

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? 
  The Gaming Room is a software company that produces an online game, Lose It or Draw It. The company wanted to branch out from their online only platform. Our company recommended a new platform.
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation? 
  The amount of research into new topics that we not really in the course material was what I was most proud of. Some additional resources touched on helping, but extraneous resources were required.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code? If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  Breaking down the development into manageable pieces made the process streamlined. I would work more on security if I had to redo this. I would use some more specifics.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 
  It's important to consider the client's needs because we've been hired to do a job. Not meeting their needs means no paycheck and no further happy clients for our portfolio. It can affect their business and ours.
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  My approach was to be able to scale the program to the largest possible audience. Instead of taking into consideration the current skillsets of my team and myself, I just went for what would please the client the most. In the future I would take on jobs that would benefit the most from our strengths and not have to burden a dev team with learning all new languages and environments.
